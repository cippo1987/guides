<p>This is just a draft of my final guide. I did not check the typos</p>
<h1 id="trips">Trips</h1>
<p>I recomend to take the cruise on thames from Greenwhich. Take it ealy in the morning, it is usually proced around 10GBP.<br>
This will take the whole morning, and it will take you to westmister. If you have time walk to Piccadilly circus, look around, take the norther line and go to Camden.<br>
Walk around camden, Little venice.</p>
